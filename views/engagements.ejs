        An engagement is a meaningful commitment between two people to marry. It marks the beginning of a shared journey toward marriage and is traditionally symbolized by an exchange of rings. The engagement period is a time for couples to celebrate their love, plan their future together, and engage with their families as they prepare for the wedding.
        <br><br>
        While the engagement itself is a personal milestone, it is often celebrated with a ceremony that brings together close family and friends. This event can range from an intimate gathering to an elaborate celebration, depending on the couple's preferences. Throughout history and across cultures, engagements have been rich with traditions, rituals, and moments of joy, signifying the couple’s bond and their promise of a lifetime together.
