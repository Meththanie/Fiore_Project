    <p>
      Traditional Uda Rata (up‑country) Sri Lankan weddings reveals that these ceremonies—also known as Kandyan weddings—center around the Poruwa ritual, performed on a beautifully decorated wooden platform that dates back to pre‑Buddhist times and was later woven into Buddhist traditions. Couples don the ornate Osariya (Kandyan sari) and handcrafted jewellery symbolizing prosperity, valour, and purity. Integral to the rites are the Ashtaka service—recital of eight sacred verses—and the Jayamangala Gatha chant, invoking auspicious blessings as family and friends look on. Each symbolic act—from the offering of betel leaves to the tying of unity threads and the breaking of a coconut—underscores unity, heritage, and the sacred commencement of the couple’s journey together.

        <h2>Pre-wedding</h2>
        <p>Udarata pre-wedding begins with Porondam Belima (horoscope matching) and the Nekatha astrological consultation to select the most auspicious wedding date. It culminates in ceremonial fittings—Nilame Adum attire for the groom and Osariya sari draping for the bride—accompanied by Magul Bera drumming and traditional blessing rites.</p>

        <h2>Post-wedding</h2>
        <p>After the Poruwa ceremony, families shower the newlyweds with rice to symbolize abundance and blessings for their married life. On the following morning, a kiribath feast of traditional milk rice brings both families together in communal celebration. Within days, the couple participates in a homecoming ceremony, visiting ancestral temples and receiving blessings as they settle into their new household.</p><br>
