        After the whirlwind of the wedding, it’s time to slow down and share some quiet joy. The Gift-Opening Party is a relaxed gathering where the newlyweds open their wedding gifts surrounded by close family and friends.
        It’s not just about presents-it’s about heartfelt moments, laughter, and gratitude. With our event planning tools, you can easily organize a cozy get-together complete with light snacks, drinks, and maybe a few games to keep things fun and personal.
